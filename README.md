# Exploratory Data Analysis of Data Science Jobs' Salaries <small> by Manuel</small>

## Objective
Starting out on a career in data science was exciting, but left me with a load of questions. Apart from the job sections involved in the rather broad ‘data science’, I wanted to find out what regions of the world had the most demand for data scientists, leading to a higher compensation, or pay. What would be the difference between working as a data analyst for a small, medium or large firm and how much does these affect your pay/growth?

This case study focuses on this, as we use data to come to accurate conclusions. Here we look into the top earners by job title across data science, and correlate it with company size, experience level, company location, etc.
